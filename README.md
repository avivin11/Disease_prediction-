It might have happened so many times that you or someone yours need doctors help immediately, but they are not available due to some reason. The Disease Prediction Portal is an end user support and online consultation project. Here, we propose a web application that allows users to get instant guidance on their disease through an intelligent system online. The application is fed with various databases such as Disease, Hospital and Doctor. The application allows user to share their symptoms. It then processes user specified symptoms to check for various diseases that could be associated with it. Here we use some intelligent probability based algorithm to predict the most accurate illness that could be associated with patient’s symptoms. It also displays detailed list of doctors’ and the hospitals they practice at. Based on result, the user can contact doctor accordingly for further treatment. The system allows user to view doctor’s details too. The system can be used for free disease prediction online.
